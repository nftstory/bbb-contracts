## Template Info

For instructions about what's included in the Foundry Template this is based on, see the
[documentation](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/foundry-template).

## Installation

### Install Foundry

Call `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`

Call `foundryup` to update Foundry.

### Install Dependencies

Dependencies are managed with pnpm. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`

### Adding Dependencies

Add dependencies from npm like so: `pnpm add @openzeppelin/contracts`

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Sepolia:

You can simulate this before doing it for real by removing `--broadcast`.

```sh
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify
```

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.

### Format

Format the contracts:

```sh
$ forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

Lint the contracts:

```sh
$ pnpm lint
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
```

Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:

```sh
$ pnpm test:coverage
```

Generate test coverage with lcov report (you'll have to open the `./coverage/index.html` file in your browser, to do so
simply copy paste the path):

```sh
$ pnpm test:coverage:report
```

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing [PRBTest](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-test) and inherit from
it in your test contract. PRBTest comes with a pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/)
environment accessible via the `vm` property. If you would like to view the logs in the terminal output you can add the
`-vvv` flag and use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog).

This template comes with an example test contract [Foo.t.sol](./test/Foo.t.sol)
